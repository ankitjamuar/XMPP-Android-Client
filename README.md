XMPP-Android-Client
===================

Android XMPP Client

This is a XMPP client for Android.

Import in to your eclipse Android project, this client uses asmack library for the implementation.

For now it only connect to xmpp server on port 5222.

Few modification as per your need:

MainActivity.java
Line no #45  ConnectionConfiguration("XMPP SERVER DOMAIN", PORT NO);
Line no #67 connection.login("USERNAME", "PASSWORD");  //dont include @DOMAIN

Shoot me mail "ankitsinha611@gmail.com" if you need further implementation.

if you need to know how to setup XMPP server, here is my blog:
